Gazebo WAM model and WAM plugins (including a ROS-based plugin)


If you're interested in controlling a WAM model in Gazebo using ROS,
checkout the WAM Model ROS folder and its README.

If you're interested in having a WAM model in Gazebo following a time-stamped
joint-trajectory given in a file, checkout the WAM Model Timed folder and its README.

NOTICE: Since I'm currently away from my home institution, I don't have access to
physical WAMs. As such, I can't guarantee that trajectories that work fine on these
models will correspond to the same trajectory on your actual WAM. Proceed with caution.
