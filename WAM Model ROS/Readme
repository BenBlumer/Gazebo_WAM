What this package will do for you:
It will let you load a model of Barrett's WAM Arm (http://www.barrett.com/) in to Gazebo simulator (gazebosim.org). You can then set the joint angles using a ROS (ros.org) node publishing a JointTrajectory or using a time-stamped joint-coordinate list. Examples of both are included.

This package contains an SDF of IRI's WAM model. It should be used with Gazebo v. 1.5 or higher. The version of Gazebo bundled with pre-Hydra ROS are outdated and should not be used. The model can be used by itself or with the joint controller plugin I've written for it. The plugin subscribes to the "joint_traj" rostopic (with timestamps).  The ros_topic should be publishing a JointTrajectory type message. An example ROS node that published what this plugin is looking for is in this folder as "exampleROSNode.py". The model is commanded to a set of joint positions when Gazebo's clock ("Sim Time") reaches the set's timestamp. 

ros_wam_plugin.cc -- This is the Gazebo plugin that controls the joints. After modifying this file, you must rebuild plugin.

wam.sdf -- This is an SDF version of IRI's WAM model. It relies on the files within "meshes" to give it the appropriate visual and collision properties.  To use the model without the joint controller, simply delete the line "<plugin name="ros_wam_plugin" filename="build/libros_wam_plugin.so"/>"

model.config tells Gazebo where everything is within this folder.

wam_world.sdf is a demo of how to load the WAM arm using a "World file".  You can add things to the world file to add other objects, change orientations, and otherwise tailor a ready-to-go set up.

CMakeList -- is used for compiling the plugin.

The script "doit.sh" compiles the plugin. You may need to delete the contents of the build folder before running the script (Excluding the ".svn" folder! Deleting it will cause syncing problems). You may also need to make the script executable. To do this, type "chmod +x doit.sh" while in the directory of the script.

To get Gazebo to recognize this model and its plugin, you have to set your Gazebo model path to the correct folder:
On a linux shell: 
  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=location/to/wam/model/folder/WAM\ Model\ ROS:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
also set the plugin path:
  export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=location/to/wam/model/folder/WAM\ Model\ ROS:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
